# RECIPE-RECOMMENDOR

Description


This Recipe Recommendation System helps users discover recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. The system uses the Spoonacular API to fetch recipe recommendations, filter them by user-selected cuisine types, and provide detailed recipe instructions, including ingredients, preparation time, and nutritional information.

Users can input their available ingredients, view a list of recipe recommendations, and select one to view the full recipe details. The application uses a simple Tkinter GUI for an interactive user experience.
